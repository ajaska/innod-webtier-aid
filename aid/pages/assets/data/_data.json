You have all supported us in our fundraising efforts, contributed to the growth of the chapter and have been there encouraging us throughout. It is also our way of saying thanks.\n\nIt is not just all work....\nWe had a lot of fun in 2012 and continue doing so. The meeting will be informal and extremely participatory.

Through sustained coverage of the farm crisis, Sainath and his colleagues forced the issue onto the collective national consciousness, and compelled a government in denial to take notice and act.
